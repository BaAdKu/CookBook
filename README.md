A Recipe Database Manager, to be using Dropbox

This is a little personal project, for my girlfriend who is a chef. 
it's supposed to help her keep her recipes, so i am planning on making a windows and android version.

it creates, stores, and opens PDFs in a specific folder in dropbox, or onedrive, or any such cloud storage client.
the "adding" process will require the input of all ingredients, at a baseline of 10 servings, which can then be adjusted in the pdf 
to the appropriate number of servings.

Using WPF, C#, PDFSharp, and probably xamarin, once i get to actually making the android app;
i probably won't be adding the app to the google playstore...
